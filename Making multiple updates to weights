To keep your code clean, there is a pre-loaded get_slope() function that takes input_data, target, 
and weights as arguments. There is also a get_mse() function that takes the same arguments. 
The input_data, target, and weights have been pre-loaded.

n_updates = 20
mse_hist = []

# Iterate over the number of updates
for i in range(n_updates):
    # Calculate the slope: slope
    slope = get_slope(input_data,target,weights)
    
    # Update the weights: weights
    weights = weights - slope * 0.01
    
    # Calculate mse with new weights: mse
    mse = get_mse(input_data,target,weights)
    
    # Append the mse to mse_hist
    mse_hist.append(mse)
    
# Plot the mse history
plt.plot(mse_hist)
plt.xlabel('Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.show()
